## How to get AnkiServer to work

You should install [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) first. Then use the following instructions to get the `anki` python package.

0. Install AnkiServer:

```
pip install AnkiServer
```

1. Get path to python home:

```
export PYTHONHOME=$(python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; import os; parts = get_python_lib().split(os.path.sep)[:-3]; print(os.path.sep.join(parts))")
```

2. Add AnkiServer to PYTHONPATH:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYTHONHOME/anki-bundled
```

# Example Usage

1. First, you need to create a new Profile in Anki. Let's say the name you chose is `darold`.

2. After creating a profile, quit Anki. You should now have a file at `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/Anki/darold/collection.anki2`.

3. Create the deck!

```
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python main.py \
--collection_path /Users/$USERNAME/Documents/Anki/darold/collection.anki2 \
--deck_name my-example-deck \
--input example.json
```

Feel free to create your own `example.json` file with your own set of names and urls.

# FAQ

Q: The directory that is meant to have my collection file doesn't exist.

A: This directory's location depends on the version of Anki you are using. From the [docs](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#managing-files-and-your-collection):

> On Mac computers, recent Anki versions store all their files in the ~/Library/Application Support/Anki2 folder. The Library folder is hidden by default, but can be revealed in Finder by holding down the option key while clicking on the Go menu. If youâ€™re on an older Anki version, your Anki files will be in your Documents/Anki folder.
